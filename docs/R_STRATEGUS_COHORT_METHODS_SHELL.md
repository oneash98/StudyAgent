# Strategus Cohort Methods Shell

Current stage scope:

- Cohort methods shell with ACP-assisted intent split and phenotype recommendation.
- The shell can derive target/comparator/outcome statements from a study intent.
- The shell can configure one effective analytic-settings profile through `step_by_step` prompts or `free_text` ACP recommendation.
- The shell writes reproducible R scripts, a Strategus analysis specification, and a merged CohortMethod execution script.
- The Keeper review step is now ACP-based and does not call the legacy Keeper R package.

This shell is provided as `slashOhdsiStrategusAssistant::runStrategusCohortMethodsShell()`.

## Running

Usage examples for `slashOhdsiStrategusAssistant::runStrategusCohortMethodsShell()` live in the R package README: `R/slashOhdsiStrategusAssistant/README.md`.

Workflow diagrams live in `docs/WORKFLOW_COHORT_METHODS.md`.

## Current Stage Flow

1. Manual collection of required identifiers:
   - `studyIntent`
2. ACP-assisted split of `studyIntent` into:
   - `targetStatement`
   - `comparatorStatement`
   - one or more outcome statements (`outcomeStatement` remains the primary/first outcome for compatibility)
   - when multiple outcome statements are suggested interactively, choose the subset to keep or enter none/0 to provide a manual outcome before editing or adding statements
3. Role-specific phenotype recommendation / cache reuse for target, comparator, and outcome cohorts.
   Interactive runs ask for short analysis labels for selected cohorts and the comparison; labels must
   be 100 characters or fewer because downstream Strategus/Characterization result tables use short
   identifier fields.
4. Optional cohort ID remap step to avoid collisions (`remapCohortIds`).
5. Copy cohort JSON definitions from `indexDir/definitions` into selected cohort folders.
6. Optional negative control and covariate concept-set IDs are still captured as placeholders.
7. Configure one analytic-settings profile through `step_by_step`, `free_text`, or cached/function-argument inputs.
   Analytic settings are always collected in this stage and confirmed before finalization.
8. Optionally run ACP-based Keeper review inline with reuse/resume controls and bounded Keeper stage gates around domain generation and case review.
9. Generate scripts in `scripts/` for cohort generation, Keeper review, diagnostics, and CohortMethod spec/execution.

## Analytic Settings

The cohort methods shell resolves a single effective analytic-settings profile. This remains
prompt/cache/free-text-driven only; there is no public function argument that accepts a complete
analytic-settings object in this stage.

Supported configuration modes:

- `step_by_step`
- `free_text`

At a high level:

- `step_by_step` covers study population, time-at-risk, propensity score adjustment, and outcome model settings.
- `free_text` uses an ACP recommendation when available and falls back to a local stub if ACP is unavailable.
- Multiple entries in those settings can be used to define sensitivity analyses within the selected profile.
- Persisted JSON keeps the existing `CohortMethod`-aligned field names.

The effective selected profile is written to `outputs/cm_analysis_defaults.json`, which retains
profile metadata such as `profile_name`, `source`, and `customized_sections`. The generated
`scripts/06_cm_spec.R` reads `analysis-settings/cmAnalysis.json`, expands `studyPeriods`,
`timeAtRisks`, `psSettings`, and `outcomeModels` into a `cmAnalysisList`, and combines that with
`outputs/cm_comparisons.json` and the selected cohort definitions to create a Strategus analysis
specification.

For traceability:

- `outputs/manual_inputs.json` stores the effective `analytic_settings` block plus the
  `customized_sections` array, the selected analytic-settings mode, and any free-text metadata.
- `outputs/cm_analytic_settings_recommendation.json` is written only for `free_text` mode. It stores the shell-facing recommendation derived from the ACP response or, if ACP is unavailable, from the local fallback.
- `outputs/cm_acp_specifications_recommendation.json` is written for `free_text` mode and stores the ACP flow request/response wrapper used to derive the shell-facing recommendation.
- `outputs/study_agent_state.json` echoes analytic-settings summary information plus the Keeper control settings used during the shell session.
- `analysis-settings/cmAnalysis.json` stores the template-shaped CohortMethod-oriented contract artifact.

Generated scripts that connect to the database expect these site-specific files at the root of
`outputDir`:

- Template `strategus-db-details.json`

```
{
  "dbms": "postgresql",
  "DB_SERVER": "localhost",
  "DB_PORT": "5432",
  "DB_USER": "ohdsi",
  "DB_PASS": "change_me",
  "DB_DRIVER_PATH": "",
  "extraSettings": "sslmode=disable"
}
```

- Template `strategus-execution-settings.json`

```
{
  "cdmDatabaseSchema": "cdm_schema",
  "workDatabaseSchema": "work_schema",
  "resultsDatabaseSchema": "results_schema",
  "vocabularyDatabaseSchema": "vocab_schema",
  "cohortTable": "cohort",
  "workFolder": "demo-strategus-cohort-method/work",
  "resultsFolder": "demo-strategus-cohort-method/results",
  "cohortIdFieldName": "cohort_definition_id"
}
```


Current Keeper specifics:

- `scripts/04_keeper_review.R` uses `runKeeperReviewWorkflow(...)` and ACP flows instead of the legacy Keeper R package.
- The script records state in `outputs/keeper_review_state.json`.
- Inline Keeper review now exposes bounded stage gates before and after each requested concept-set domain and before and after case review.
- The default generated script exposes `ACP_TIMEOUT`, concept-set reuse/overwrite, row reuse/resume, and explicit row selection controls such as `1-3,5`.
- Manual editing of `keeper-case-review/concept-sets-approved/*.json` is consumable, but the concept-set approve/edit/rerun UX is still incomplete.

## Current Boundaries

- `phenotype_improvements` is wired for target, comparator, and outcome cohorts. The shell writes role-specific improvement artifacts after prompting whether to run improvements for each role, can apply mutating actions (`set`, `replace`, `update`), keeps advisory `note` actions as recommendations, and keeps `patched-cohorts/` complete for downstream scripts when any mutating improvement is applied.
- Remaining deferred integration points:
  - comparator reuse lookup
  - phenotype index search for suggestion workflows
- Atlas settings deferred in this stage:
  - negative control cohort-definition logic
  - positive control synthesis
  - empirical calibration configuration
  - detailed covariate feature-group selection beyond the current default-plus-include/exclude model
- TODO: implement ACP/MCP support for negative control and covariate concept-set workflows, then update the shell to use those tools instead of writing dummy placeholder concept-set artifacts.
- Covariate concept-set include/exclude is not fully implemented yet. Because the generated CohortMethod scripts cannot currently materialize exclude covariate concepts, high-correlation covariates may remain in the model and cause `06_cm_spec.R` to fail when `errorOnHighCorrelation` is enabled.
- Analytic-settings recommendations are mapped into shell settings before script generation, but there is not yet a dedicated validation layer for ACP recommendation payloads.
- Multiple analytic-settings profiles remain for a later stage. Within the single selected
  target/comparator comparison and analytic-settings profile, `06_cm_spec.R` expands the
  template-shaped `cmAnalysis.json` array fields into multiple CohortMethod analyses.

## Notes

- This stage is designed as a bridge: it combines ACP/MCP-assisted intent split, phenotype recommendation/improvement, analytic-settings recommendation, and ACP-based Keeper review with reproducible Strategus script generation.
- Interactive runs support `/back` at major stage boundaries for study intent, target selection, comparator selection, outcome selection, study configuration, and Keeper-review entry while keeping `/ohdsi` available for contextual guidance.
- If no Keeper artifacts exist yet, the shell suppresses the inline Keeper reuse/resume prompts instead of asking about caches unconditionally.
